            In many measurement systems, including the Imperial System and the United States Customary system, a foot is
            a unit of length.
            ft is used to represent a foot. One foot is equivalent to 1/5280 miles, or 0.000189394 miles. Long distances
            are measured in miles,
            which is the standard unit of length. The length of a mile is 5280 feet. The letter mi stands for a mile.
        </p>
        <h2>How To Convert Feet To Miles?</h2>
        <p>
            To derive the value of miles, we have to multiply the value of feet by 0.000189394 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="formula">Miles = Feet x 0.000189394</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also understand the concept with an example, suppose we have to convert the 100 feet into a miles.
        </p>
        <p>
            100 feet x 0.000189394 = 0.0189394 miles
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also convert the feet into miles in the following manner since one mile is equivalent to 5280 feet, 
            therefore we have to divide the length in feet by 5280
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="formula">Mile = feet / 5280</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also understand the concept with an example, suppose we have to convert the 100 feet into a miles.
        </p>
        <p>
            100 feet /5280= 0.0189394 miles
        </p>

        <p>In life sometimes we will not have enough time to write the formula then enter the numbers into the
            calculator and get the result on the screen.
            When you work with conversions from one unit to another, the numbers can get a little confusing. Especially
            when dealing with really large numbers.
